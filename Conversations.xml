      <text>Wanderer! Orphan of the salt! Hear me!

To the North and the West, through the Great Salt Desert, the Six Day Stilt splits the earth in two! Seek there the grandeur of Shekhinah, First among Fathers. Release yourself from the burden that chrome bears on your sickly flesh.

Go, now!</text>

Deliverance waits for all pilgrims.

At the site, you will find the cathedral, magnificent in its splendor. There are statues erected in honor of the Argent Fathers. There are sublime reliefs depicting our most cherished occasions. Hear, too, the wisdom of Eschelstadt II, our highest priest, and make a donation at the Sacred Well. Worship at the light sculpture of Shekhinah Himself.

You will find other pilgrims among the merchant tents at the Stiltgrounds bazaar, other converts and priests. You will be among friends.
