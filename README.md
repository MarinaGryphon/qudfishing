# Qud Fishing
This mod adds fishing to Caves Of Qud! Now you can make or find a fishing rod and use it to capture delicious fish from various water pools! 

To fish: first equip a Fishing Rod and then interact with water. You will cast a line. If you are successful you will reel in a fish!
Sitting on a chair increases your chance of catching things.

The skill "Fishing" is listed under "Cooking And Gathering". If you have the fishing skill then you can cast your line once and then wait by passing turns until you catch a fish. The fishing skill also drastically increases the variety of fish you can catch.

Fishing rods can be purchased from Argyve, created with Tinkering, or found throughout the world.
